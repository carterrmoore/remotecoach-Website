      <span class="c1">We just talked about sleep and water didn&rsquo;t we? Yep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Because they are so essential to our lives those two things are major components of many aspects of our lives. So getting enough water throughout the day and sleeping and waking at the same time every day are important but we must do more than that. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Those are important pieces but we will finish the puzzle today.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">5. THE EARTH SPINS &amp; THE SUN AND MOON CORRELATE WITH OUR ENERGY PATTERNS. WE NEED SUN EXPOSURE, WE SLEEP WITH THE MOON.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">We need to get rhythm with the Sun and Moon and make the most of what they provide us. Sunlight is essential for getting much needed Vitamin D, so in the winter months when if you, go to work when it is dark and leave the office when it is dark, getting out in the crisp winter sun during lunch is extremely important! We need about 30-45 minutes of direct sunshine per day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">For many of us, when things in our life get busy the first thing that we are willing to compromise on is our sleep. You can&rsquo;t hack how much sleep you need as a human, 5 hours is never enough for us. 8 to 8.5 hours is the sweet spot or minimum to maintain good energy levels. We over supplement on caffeine and other stimulants to combat this, but in time you will ultimately burn out, get ill, as you get more and more into a sleep deprived state. If nothing else, consider getting more sleep - it is the one thing you can do to help boost your health immediately! </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Action Step(s):</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;For daily sunshine, try and get most of your sunshine first thing in the morning. Wake up with the sun, then get some sunshine!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">For your sleep, try adding an extra 15-30 minutes every night, each week until you feel good throughout the day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">6. WATER, MOVING BLOOD &amp; DIGESTION ARE ESSENTIAL DAILY ROUTINES</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Sufficient water as we mentioned previously is key to maintaining optimal energy levels and alertness throughout the day. Movement or exercise is also massively important for us. We are quite simply not meant to be sat down every day, this is so unbelievably bad for us and we are only just starting to realize now how much so. If you sit at a desk, try to get up and move around just for a couple of minutes every half hour. Get a proper break every 90 minutes and also think about how you are actually sitting at your desk! </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Action Step: Aim for 10,000 steps as a minimum for all of us and this is separate to any exercise you do in the gym. Try adding 500-1,000 steps each day until you&#39;re there.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This is where we can really see habits create health. Big impacts from small actions. By doing things on purpose with purpose, consistently - over time you will see and feel the results. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4">
